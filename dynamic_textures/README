This folder holds the folders that hold dynamic textures, do not delete this folder.

Dynamic textures are not automatically loaded when the app starts unlike the texture packs. They can be loaded with "loadDynamicTextures" scripting API.

PNG is the supported default file extension. Texture compressions are handled automatically by ROYGBIV engine.

You can load dynamic textures using the command:
 "newDynamicTextureFolder folderName"
