This folder holds the Texture Packs, do not delete this folder.

Each Texture Pack is a directory containing different type of maps/textures
for the same object:

diffuse.png -> For diffuse maps
alpha.png -> For alpha maps (black: invisible, white: visible)
ao.png -> For ambient occulsion maps
emissive.png -> For emissive maps
normal.png -> For normal maps
specular.png -> For specular maps
height.png -> For height/displacement maps

PNG is the supported default file extension. Texture compressions are handled automatically by ROYGBIV engine.
So all you need to do is to put PNG images into folders. Note that a texture pack folder is only valid
if it at least contains a "diffuse.png".

You can load Texture Packs using the command:
  "newTexturePack name"
