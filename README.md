# ROYGBIV

![](/screen_shots/logo.png?raw=true)

ROYGBIV is a WebGL game engine for motivated programmers who do not have the budget for buying fancy 3D models or licensing a popular engine but still want to make 60 FPS web games for both mobile and desktop. It is being developed by one of such programmers on top of low level THREE.js features for the graphics and CANNON.js for physics. It is named after this [Boards of Canada track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-GWjzw0GwQ).

## The current state of the project
ROYGBIV is still under development and not documented yet. Estimated documentation release date is September 2019.

## How to run?

* Download or clone the repository.
* If you don't have nodejs/npm download them.
* Go inside the repository (where server.js is), using the command line run **npm install**
* Run **node server** to start the server. You should see something like this:
