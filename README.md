# ROYGBIV

ROYGBIV is a 3D game engine for the Web and on the Web. I named it after my favorite [Boards of Canada track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-GWjzw0GwQ).

## The current state of the project

ROYGBIV is still under development. You can watch demo videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfDfMiMjN3P_K_vMLUbp7QA?view_as=subscriber). I upload new videos when I develop some cool feature :)

## How to run?

ROYGBIV works on browsers (preferably Chrome or Firefox). It works with a set of commands typed to its command line interface so a documentation will be provided when the project is finished. To install follow these steps:

* Download or clone the repository.
* If you don't have nodejs/npm download them.
* Go inside the repository (where server.js is), using the command line run **npm install express** if you don't have the nodejs express module
* Run **node server** to start the server. You should see something like this:
