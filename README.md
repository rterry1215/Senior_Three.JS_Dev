# ROYGBIV

ROYGBIV is a 3D game engine for the Web. I named it after my favorite [Boards of Canada track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-GWjzw0GwQ).

## The current state of the project

ROYGBIV is still under development. You can watch demo videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfDfMiMjN3P_K_vMLUbp7QA?view_as=subscriber). I upload new videos when I develop some cool feature :)
