# ROYGBIV

![](/screen_shots/logo.png?raw=true)

ROYGBIV is a WebGL game engine for motivated programmers who do not have the budged for buying fancy 3D models or licensing a popular engine but still want to make 60 FPS web games. It is being developed by one of such programmers on top of low level THREE.js features for the graphics and CANNON.js for physics. It is names after this [Boards of Canada track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-GWjzw0GwQ).

## The current state of the project
ROYGBIV is still under development. You can watch demo videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfDfMiMjN3P_K_vMLUbp7QA?view_as=subscriber). I upload new videos when I develop some cool feature :)

## How to run?

ROYGBIV works on browsers (preferably Chrome or Firefox). It works with a set of commands typed to its command line interface so a documentation will be provided when the project is finished. To install, follow these steps:

* Download or clone the repository.
* If you don't have nodejs/npm download them.
* Go inside the repository (where server.js is), using the command line run **npm install**
* Run **node server** to start the server. You should see something like this:
