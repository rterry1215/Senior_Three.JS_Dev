This folder holds OBJ models. Use "models" CLI command to load models from this
folder into your project. Each child folder represents a model and must contain
an .obj and a .mtl file (and/or textures). Note that if the model contains
any textures, texture images under the model folder must respect
ACCEPTED_TEXTURE_SIZE parameter.
