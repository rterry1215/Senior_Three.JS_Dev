This folder holds OBJ models. Use "models" CLI command to load models from this
folder into your project. Each child folder represents a model and must contain
an .obj and a .mtl file (and/or textures). Note that if the model contains
any textures, texture images under the model folder must respect
ACCEPTED_TEXTURE_SIZE parameter.

In order to activate augmented reality view for given model, a folder named
"ar" may be added under the model folder. This folder should contain .usdz and
.glb files:

  * model_with_texture1.usdz
  * model_with_texture1.glb
  * model_with_texture2.usdz
  ...

AR view may then be activated via startAugmentedReality scripting API:

  ROYGBIV.startAugmentedReality(modelInstance, "model_with_texture1");
