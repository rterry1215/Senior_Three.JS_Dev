This folder holds the Skybox textures, do not delete this folder.

Each Skybox texture MUST contain the following images:

back.png -> the back face of the cube
down.png -> the down face of the cube
front.png -> the front face of the cube
left.png -> the left face of the cube
right.png -> the right face of the cube
up.png -> the up face of the cube

The engine automatically handles the texture compression, so only put PNGs
under this folder.

You can load Skybox textures using the command:
  "newSkybox name"
