This folder holds the bootscreen folders. A custom bootscreen may be loaded via
the settings GUI (settings CLI command). Each bootscreen folder may contain:

* Mandatory: component.html -> The HTML implementation of the bootscreen. Usually a file containing just a DIV.
* component.css -> The injected css
* component.ttf -> The injected font
* Any additional images/files

Additional files may be loaded via a relative path -> "./bootscreens/[bootscreen name]/[file name]"

These DOM ids are not safe to use in component.html:

* cliDiv
* rendererCanvas
* customBootscreen
